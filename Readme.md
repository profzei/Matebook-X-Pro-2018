## Introduction

This repo contains the files needed for getting macOS working on a **Huawei MateBook X Pro (2018 Edition)** laptop with OpenCore.
* This is intended to create a "fully" functional (as far as possible) hackintosh for the Huawei Matebook X Pro.
* The project can be considered **stable**.
* With each new release of macOS we need to resolve each new "minor issue" we run into. All of the steps I made to get to this point were a result of countless hours of reading along with trial and error, however I'm glad to say that **I learned a lot** in the meantime. I am by no means an expert so any effective help (suggestions, observations, ...) to tune this project is very appreciated!
* If you would like to get started with creating a hackintosh on your MBXP but have non experience, I would highly recommend following [**Dortania's OpenCore Install guide**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) and then returning here for troubleshooting or last improvements.


### Summary

- The **compatibility** is **very good** for the most part, most of the stuff works like it would on a real MacBook, including camera, audio, touchpad, iCloud services.
- The **experience** is **pleasant**, as the laptop is smooth and responsive under macOS Big Sur/Catalina.
- **Battery life** is **quite great** (from personal experience it **lasts from 8 to 10 hours** for light works depending on its age with a behaviour very similar to Windows 10 as shown in the macOS menu bar screenshots below).
- The **Intel WiFi** card is soldered onto the motherboard, which means it can't be replaced with a Broadcom one, but the Intel card is now **functional albeit not operating at full speeds** (however it is fine for most use cases). With the latest `AirportItlwm.kext` even **Handoff** and **Continuity** features are working, but with a very limited support for AirDrop and Apple Watch unlocking (see [Changelog for OpenIntelWireless release v. 1.2.0 stable](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases)).
For any issues about `AirportItlwm.kext` please refer first to [**OpenIntelWireless Troubleshooting page**](https://openintelwireless.github.io/itlwm/Troubleshooting.html#kernel-extension-loading-status) and then to [**OpenIntelWireless Gitter Page**](https://gitter.im/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

### Generate your own SMBIOS Information

For privacy reasons, all SMBIOS information has been wiped out in the configuration file `EFI/OC/config.plist`. You need to generate your unique `SMBIOS` info by yourself (recommend to use [**CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS**](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)), and inject them into your `config.plist`.
- With every **EFI update** you retrieve from [here](https://github.com/profzei/Matebook-X-Pro-2018/releases), please, remember to transfer your Device details under `PlatformInfo -> Generic` in your `config.plist`.
- For more details on **dual booting settings**, please, see also below [**OpenCore**](https://github.com/profzei/Matebook-X-Pro-2018#bootloader-firmware) notes.

<summary><strong>Notes</strong></summary>

1. **Intel Bluetooth** could not support some Bluetooth devices like some Bluetooth mouse since it is only a firmware injector; please, report any issues not here but only on [**OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware Gitter Chat**](https://gitter.im/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
2. **Touchscreen support is disabled by default** since [release v. 1.8.0](https://github.com/profzei/Matebook-X-Pro-2018/releases). Why? It seems that all `VoodooI2C` versions after 2.4 are affected to a greater or lesser extent by `Multi_GPI0` issues.
The solution proposed so far by `VoodooI2C` developers is only a workaround and not a real fix: proposing to use the `GPI0` pinning for touchpad and polling method for touchscreen is not a real fix because this approach increases interrupts and causes a degrade in battery life. This being the case and not needing to use the touchscreen in my daily work, for the moment I have disabled this function pending improvements that can only come from `VoodooI2C` developers.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Notes: NVMe SSD support</strong></summary>

1. Very rarely some users reported the following kernel panic after sleep:
```
panic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff800b6ce860): nvme: "Fatal error occurred. CSTS=0xffffffff
...
```
It's certainly a `NVMe` error, but it is not due to **EFI** released in the present repo:
- it may be due to the power management of **your NVMe device** (mine is a **LiteON SSD PCIe NVMe 512 GB [CA3-8D512]**)
- reference to this issue is in **acidanthera/bugtracker#1193** [IGP causes NVMe Kernel Panic CSTS=0xffffffff](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/1193)

In case you run into such an issue, it is recommended adding `forceRenderStandby=0` boot-args in your `config.plist` to disable `RC6 Render Standby`.

2. If your laptop has a **Samsung PM981 NVMe SSD** or **any unsupported SSD** listed in [dortania/bugtracker#192](https://github.com/dortania/bugtracker/issues/192), then it's obviously **not supported here**. I have no way to make my **EFI** work on broken `IONVME` compatibility SSDs.

Obvious solutions:
- buy another (internal) NVMe SSD
- or install macOS on an external SSD drive

Even if your macOS installed on an external SSD drive, you need to add a new ACPI patch to **disable** PM981 (or other **non-supported NVMe** SSDs) **detection on macOS**:
```
DefinitionBlock ("", "SSDT", 2, "HUAWEI", "_DRP05", 0)
{
	External (OSDW, MethodObj)

    External (_SB_.PCI0.RP05, DeviceObj)

    Scope (\_SB.PCI0.RP05)
    {
        OperationRegion (DE01, PCI_Config, 0x50, One)
        Field (DE01, AnyAcc, NoLock, Preserve)
        {
                ,   1, 
                ,   3, 
            DDDD,   1
        }
    }

    Scope (\)
    {
        If (OSDW ())
        {
            \_SB.PCI0.RP05.DDDD = One
        }
    }
}
```

<summary><strong>Notes: Bios version</strong></summary>

If your BIOS version is `> 1.30` then edit `config.plist` disabling `SSDT-BIOS.aml` in `ACPI -> Add` section:
- method `_QBF` (related to battery thermal management) is added only for BIOS versions up to `1.30` since it was introduced by **Huawei** starting from v. `1.33`. 
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Catalina (or Mojave) support for AirportItlwm</strong></summary>

If you use this release in **macOS Catalina** you need to make the following changes in the `config.plist` to make `AirportItlwm.kext` support active:
- `DmgLoading` set to `Signed`
- `SecureBootModel` set to `Default`
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Thunderbolt support</strong></summary>

As reported in [NotebookCheck review](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Huawei-has-pulled-a-Dell-the-MateBook-X-Pro-uses-a-gimped-Thunderbolt-3-port.316550.0.html) our Matebook X pro (2018) is utilizing only half the PCIe lanes for its single Thunderbolt 3 port (TB). Thus, its PCIe x2 Thunderbolt 3 port is only capable of providing a maximum of 20 Gbps instead of 40 Gbps when compared to a standard Thunderbolt 3 port with PCIe x4 lanes.

The connector type is Usb-C and it can do multiple protocols (TB, USB 2/3/3.1, DP, etc...) with different backing controllers. The problem on Hackintoshes is mostly about TB on Usb-C, because the firmware and power management of Apple's TB-controllers works entirely different than those for other OS'es. So even if it's the same hardware found on Windows laptops, they don't "just work" because of the different firmware.

The ACPI-part for handling Thunderbolt 3 port and its power management has been implemented:
- it enables not only the PCIe-to-PCIe-bridge mode of the TB controller but also the native drivers which make it possible to completely poweroff the controller after using the TB port, saving battery life and prevent the controller from preventing the CPU goes into deeper C-State
- the ICM is disabled on boot to let OSX' drivers take over the job
- the TB port works when any device is plugged into it at the boot time: this means no hot-plug
- it's largely untested since I don't have any TB 3 devices.

For reference, see [Thunderbolt 3 Fix](https://osy.gitbook.io/hac-mini-guide/details/thunderbolt-3-fix-part-3) and [ThunderboltPatcher](https://github.com/osy86/ThunderboltPatcher) for related attempts to fix TB by patching its firmware.

Due to lack of Thunderbolt devices my interest in this feature is very marginal; therefore, in my default `config.plist`, **Thunderbolt controller has been left disabled**.

Steps for enabling support for Thunderbolt controller (`\_SB.PCI0.RP09`):
- disable `SSDT-DTB3.aml`
- enable all `SSDT-TB-DSB*.aml`
- enable `TB3: _GPE.NTFY,1,S to XTFY` binary patch
- enable `TB3: RP9._INI,0,N to XINI` binary patch
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's not working: incompatible Hardware</strong></summary>

- [ ] **Discrete graphics card** (NVIDIA GeForce MX150) is not working, since macOS doesn't support Optimus technology
	- Have used `SSDT-DDGPU.aml` to disable it in order to save power.
- [ ] **Fingerprint sensor** is not working
	- Fingerprint readers on Macbooks are managed by T2 chip which has not been very throughly reverse engineered yet
	- Have used `SSDT-XHC.aml` to disable it (in order to save some power).
</details>

## Bootloader Firmware
- Default bootloader: `OpenCore 0.7.3` [Official release](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases). See more info in [Wiki section](https://github.com/profzei/Matebook-X-Pro-2018/wiki/Converting-from-Clover-to-OpenCore) about migration.
- No longer maintained: Clover `r5118` [Official release](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader/releases) ~~`r5103` [Dids release](https://github.com/Dids/clover-builder/releases)~~

<details>
<summary><strong>OpenCore</strong></summary>

- Support macOS 10.14 ~ macOS 11.6
- **For dual-booting systems, Windows Activation may fail due to different hardware UUID generated by OpenCore**
	- According to [OpenCore Official Configuration](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Configuration.pdf), you are highly recommended to inject the **original Windows system UUID** to `PlatformInfo -> Generic - >SystemUUID` in `EFI/OC/config.plist`: run `wmic csproduct get UUID` command in Windows PowerShell app 
- Limited theme with `OpenCanopy`: a cleaner version with custom graphics has been provided by **@R-Teer**
</details>

## Post - Install Settings
<details>
<summary><strong>Enable Tap (with one finger) for Touchpad</strong></summary>

Starting from [VoodooI2C v. 2.4.1](https://github.com/VoodooI2C/VoodooI2C/releases), the **click down** action is emulated to **force touch**, which causes the failure of click down and drag gestures.

For example, you can turn off `Force Click` in `System Preferences -> Trackpad` or choose three finger drag in `System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Mouse & Trackpad -> Trackpad Options`

Suggested configuration:
<p align="center">
<img src="Wiki/Images/ScreenTouchpad.png" width="75%" alt="Touchpad Settings" />
</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Enable Apple Services</strong></summary>

If **Serial numbers** have been correctly generated, these services (iMessage, FaceTime, ...) should work for you. If not, [clean up](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#clean-out-old-attempts) and generate new serial number for your **SMBIOS**.

Default **SMBIOS** settings of this repo is `MacBookPro15,2` ~~`MacBookPro14,1`~~ ~~`MacBookPro16,3`~~
1. Launch `Terminal` app
2. Copy the following script, paste it into the `Terminal` window, then press `Enter`
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS && cd GenSMBIOS && ./GenSMBIOS.command 
   ```
3. Type `2`, then press `Enter`
4. Drag your `config.plist` inside the `Terminal` window
5. Type `3`, then press `Enter`
6. Type `MacBookPro15,2`, then press `Enter`
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Sleep & Hibernation settings</strong></summary>

**Sleep** function works flawlessly (both via software and via clamshell) like **hibernation** (suspend to disk or S4 sleep). In order to get automatic sleep working properly like real Macs, the following settings are mandatory: 
```
sudo pmset -a standby 0
sudo pmset -a powernap 0 
sudo pmset -a proximitywake 0
sudo pmset -a tcpkeepalive 0
sudo pmset -a womp 0
```
- `powernap` will wake up the system from time to time to check mail, make Time Machine backups, etc...
- `proximitywake` can wake your machine when an iDevice is near.
- `tcpkeepalive` has resolved periodic wake events after setting up iCloud.
- `womp` is wake on lan.

Default macOS setting is **hibernatemode 3** i.e. **sleep mode**.

**After every update, ALL these settings should be reapplied manually!**

Suggested configuration in `System Preferences -> Bluetooth -> Advanced` for **Bluetooth devices** for avoiding random wake events during sleep:

<p align="center">
<img src="Wiki/Images/ScreenBluetooth.png" width="80%" alt="Bluetooth settings" />
</p>

**Hibernation mode** can be enabled only via console command `sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25` and is fully supported by Matebook X Pro (obviously using `HibernationFixup` kext). If, however, you would like to disable it, then
```
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0
sudo rm -rf /private/var/vm/sleepimage
sudo touch /private/var/vm/sleepimage
sudo chflags uchg /private/var/vm/sleepimage
```

You can verify your power settings by typing in terminal `sudo pmset -g live` . If you ever want to reset these settings: `sudo pmset -a restoredefaults`

About power consumption, [HWMonitor](https://github.com/kzlekk/HWSensors/releases) reports for the idle state both before and after sleep phase the same value for "CPU package total" (0.65-0.70 W). Sleep discharge rate is about 1% every 4:30 hours (during night).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Power Management settings</strong></summary>

With `CPUFriend.kext` and `SSDT-PM.aml` we achieved a **very good power management on battery** for [Intel Core i7-8550U](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/122589/intel-core-i7-8550u-processor-8m-cache-up-to-4-00-ghz.html) (without compromising performance) as reported in the following macOS menu bar screeshots:
- a mean 10% rate discharge for hour
- temperature range from 30°C to 40°C for light/medium CPU workload
- a mean `CPU package total` value of about 0.65-0.70 W for idle state

<summary><strong>Activate Surround Sound via MIDI</strong></summary>

By default macOS only uses 2 out of our MBXP 4 speakers: if you want to achieve a **surround sound system** on macOS, you need to create an **Aggregate Device**. But then macOS does not allow you to control the volume of the sound: yes, it is real and is a general behaviour of MacBookPro machines.

For a detailed guide on how to activate surround sound via MIDI on internal speakers and native audio shortcuts, see [Wiki section](https://github.com/profzei/Matebook-X-Pro-2018/wiki/Activate-Surround-Sound-via-MIDI-on-internal-speakers)

<summary><strong>Undervolt using VoltageShift</strong></summary>

Undervolting is a great way to maximise performance, lower power consumption and reduce temperatures.

For a detailed guide on how to undervolt our MBXP using `VoltageShift` from the EFI folder instead of disabling SIP, see [Wiki section](https://github.com/profzei/Matebook-X-Pro-2018/wiki/Undervolt-via-VoltageShift) 
</details>


## Optional Settings
<details>  
<summary><strong>Add custom shortcuts to F7, F9 & F10 hotkeys</strong></summary>

With the latest update and inclusion of the new `SSDT-KBD.aml` we are now able to reconfigure the shortcuts to custom settings.

For a detailed guide on how to enable original `F7`, `F9` & `F10` hotkeys using native **Automator** app, please see [Wiki section](https://github.com/profzei/Matebook-X-Pro-2018/wiki/Add-custom-shortcuts-to-Fn-hotkeys).

Otherwise, you can follow these suggestions [credit **@R-Teer**]:
- There are various freeware software tools to achive this such as [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) or [Ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/).
- Personally I use the application [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/), which is paid but incredibly useful and allows custom trackpad gestures amongst other features.
- My current settings are as follows:

<summary><strong>Increase Launchpad icons number</strong></summary>

By default (for a 13 inch MacBook Pro), the Launchpad shows the icons in 5×7 format.

Type in Terminal the following commands:
```
defaults write com.apple.dock springboard-rows -int 6
defaults write com.apple.dock springboard-columns -int 9;killall Dock
```
Relaunch the Launchpad to see the icons are changed now.

Finally you can revert to the default setting with the following commands:
```
defaults delete com.apple.dock springboard-rows
defaults delete com.apple.dock springboard-columns
defaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool TRUE;killall Dock
```
(**Warning**: the last command also will remove any custom folders you have created)

<details>  
<summary><strong>Make macOS zsh Terminal colorful</strong></summary>

The **default macOS Terminal** looks very lame since it lacks in visibility: things should be colorful like Ubuntu. 
In the following steps, a proper solution for that is given **without installing any custom theme**:
- Choose any black theme first as the color combination of my snippet is dark theme friendly
- Open **Terminal** and type:
```
cd
touch zshrc
open zshrc
```
- Append the following code in the file:
```
export CLICOLOR=1
export LSCOLORS=GxBxCxDxCxegedabagaced
```
- Save the file and quit your default editor
- In **Terminal** type:
```
mv zshrc .zshrc
```
- Quit **Terminal** (`cmd + q`)
- Now open a new **Terminal** window and the changes will be reflected

#### How did the customization worked?

By setting `CLICOLOR=1` you are enabling colors.

`LSCOLORS` is the variable where you will define which file should display what color: it is used to color the directory and file list. 
It provides you 11 positions, each with `FB` (foregroundColor backgroundColor) combination. Thus it contains 22 characters. Below is the details of which position means what:
1. directory
2. symbolic link
3. socket
4. pipe
5. executable
6. block special
7. character special
8. executable with setuid bit set
9. executable with setgid bit set
10. directory writable to others, with sticky bit
11. directory writable to others, without sticky

The colors for each position are placed as `FB` format; below is the list which color means what:
- `a`: black
- `b`: red
- `c`: green
- `d`: brown
- `e`: blue
- `f`: magenta
- `g`: cyan
- `h`: light grey
- `A`: bold black, usually shows up as dark grey
- `B`: bold red
- `C`: bold green
- `D`: bold brown, usually shows up as yellow
- `E`: bold blue
- `F`: bold magenta
- `G`: bold cyan
- `H`: bold light grey; looks like bright white
- `x`: default foreground or background

The colors mentioned above are ANSI colors, but according to the version of your macOS or terminal, they may differ a little.

<summary><strong>Remove Eject icon from macOS menu bar</strong></summary>

Apple no longer sells any Mac with a built-in optical drive, but many users still rely on CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs for both work and entertainment.

**How do I get rid of this icon?**
- Press and hold the `Apple/Command` key
- Click and drag the `Eject` menu icon off the menu bar
- Once you start dragging the `Eject` icon, you can release the `Apple/Command` key
- When you see a small "x" icon appear, then release the mouse button: it will remove the `Eject` icon from your menu bar.

**How to add Eject icon to menu bar**
- From the macOS desktop, make sure *Finder* is the active application and then select `Go -> Go to Folder` from the menu bar. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Shift-Command-G`
- Enter the following location: `/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/`
- Find and double-click on `Eject.menu`

<summary><strong>Dual Booting: fix Windows time</strong></summary>

Windows uses local time by default while macOS uses universal time. You can switch Windows 
to use universal time.
Open up a command prompt in Windows as an administrator and copy and paste this in:
```
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation" /v RealTimeIsUniversal /d 1 /t REG_QWORD /f
```
That will make Windows use universal time instead of local time.
Then update your clock via the built-in internet time setting to update the time.

## Dev. Notes

In [**Wiki section**](https://github.com/profzei/Matebook-X-Pro-2018/wiki) are stored some significant/**advanced technical guides**.

<details>
<summary><strong>USB port mapping scheme</strong></summary>

Proper `SSDT-XHC.aml` is used for USB Host Controller (XHCI-Device-ID: `<2f 9d 00 00>`): this file is configured to map only the necessary ports (tested with IOReg) with the correct connector type and prevent it from shutdown issues.

| Port      | Address               | Physical Location                                         | Internal/External |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| HS01/SS01 | `00000001`/`0000000D` | Left Port type-C (Power Source) - next to 3.5mm jack port | E                 |
| HS02/SS02 | `00000002`/`0000000E` | Right Port type-A                                         | E                 |
| HS03      | `00000003`            | Left Port type-C Thunderbolt                              | E                 |
| HS05      | `00000005`            | Bluetooth USB Port                                        | I                 |
| HS07      | `00000007`            | Integrated HD Camera module                               | I                 |

<details>
<summary><strong>Boot arguments</strong></summary>

A very minimal set of boot arguments has been achieved for actual `config.plist`:
1. `igfxrpsc=1` enables **RPS** control patch and improves **IGPU performance**
2. `itlwm_cc=IT` changes/enables the country code to **IT-Italy** for `AirportItlwm.kext`
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Fixing Xcode issue</strong></summary>

If you encounter an issue with Xcode, you could kill it with the following commands:
```
killall Xcode
xcrun -k
xcodebuild -alltargets clean
rm -rf "$(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/org.llvm.clang/ModuleCache"
rm -rf "$(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/org.llvm.clang.$(whoami)/ModuleCache"
rm -rf /Applications/Xcode.app
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer
rm -rf ~/Library/MobileDevice
rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dt.Xcode.plist
rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dt.xcodebuild.plist
sudo rm -rf /Library/Preferences/com.apple.dt.Xcode.plist
sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Receipts/com.apple.pkg.XcodeExtensionSupport.bom
sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Receipts/com.apple.pkg.XcodeExtensionSupport.plist
sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Receipts/com.apple.pkg.XcodeSystemResources.bom
sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Receipts/com.apple.pkg.XcodeSystemResources.plist
sudo rm -rf /private/var/db/receipts/com.apple.pkg.Xcode.bom
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Fixing Command Line Tools</strong></summary>

It may occur Big Sur (or Xcode) updates remove the CLT which are, for example, required by Homebrew.
Simply removing their folder and reinstalling them worked; open your `Terminal` app and type the following commands:
```
sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
sudo xcode-select --install
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Fixing Notification banner</strong></summary>

It may occur some notifications won't appear in Big Sur (check you don't have "Do not Disturb" on...).
Simply deleting `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ncprefs.plist` and then restart your machine.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Changing Mac computer name</strong></summary>

- Open your `Terminal` app and perform the following tasks to change the workstation hostname using the `scutil` command
```
sudo scutil --set HostName ""
sudo scutil --set ComputerName "MacBook Pro"
sudo scutil --set LocalHostName MacBook-Pro
```
where
1. **HostName** is your fully qualified hostname
2. **ComputerName** is the user-friendly computer name you see in **Finder**
3. **LocalHostName** is the name usable on the local network i.e. the **Bonjour** hostname of your Mac

- Flush the DNS cache by typing `dscacheutil -flushcache`
- Restart the device.

</details>

<details>  
<summary><strong>Fix AppleID issue on macOS Catalina</strong></summary>

- If you encounter the problem with AppleID which cannot login and logout, this problem happened on both Hackintosh and Macintosh.
- Fix this issue with the following commands:
```
sudo -v
killall -9 accountsd com.apple.iCloudHelper
defaults delete MobileMeAccounts
rm -rf ~/Library/Accounts
killall -9 accountsd com.apple.iCloudHelper
sudo reboot
```
