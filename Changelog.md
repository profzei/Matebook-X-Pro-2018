	Update to **macOS Sequoia 15.0 (24A335)**
	
	**Update**
	- Bluetooth is working fine: atm I'm using [these kexts](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware/issues/486#issuecomment-2356055645) for `BlueToolFixup`, `IntelBluetoothFirmware` and `IntelBTPatcher`.
	
	**OpenCore**
    - Update `config.plist`:
        - Added `NVRAM -> Add -> 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 -> bluetoothExternalDongleFailed` [entry](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware/issues/486#issuecomment-2356055645)
		- Added `NVRAM -> Add -> 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 -> bluetoothInternalControllerInfo` [entry](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware/issues/486#issuecomment-2356055645)
        - Added `NVRAM -> Delete -> 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 -> bluetoothExternalDongleFailed` [entry](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware/issues/486#issuecomment-2356055645)
		- Added `NVRAM -> Delete -> 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 -> bluetoothInternalControllerInfo` [entry](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware/issues/486#issuecomment-2356055645)


> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Change `Misc -> Security -> SecureBootModel` from `Default` to `Disabled` prior to updating to **macOS Sequoia**. You can re-enable it afterwards; otherwise the update (or new install) fails!


- **09-07-2024**

	Update to **macOS Sequoia 15.0 (24A5331b)** Beta 8
	
	
> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - `hibernatemode 0` is working fine (i.e. standard sleep);
> - `hibernatemode 25` is working fine (i.e. standard hibernation);
> - `hibernatemode 3` is **not** working fine (i.e. MacBook sleep + hibernation);
> - Bluetooth is still broken: `IntelBluetoothFirmware`, `BlueToolFixup` and `IntelBTPatcher` kexts are all loaded correctly but there is no device nor related information in `System Information -> Bluetooth` section (while **Bluetooth USB Host Controller** is correctly loaded in `System Information -> USB` section).


- **08-25-2024**

	Update to **macOS Sequoia 15.0 (24A5327a)** Beta 7
	
	**Update**
	- Update [kext] `BlueToolFixup` v. 2.6.9 beta
	- Update [kext] `IntelBluetoothFirmware` v. 2.5.0 beta (for macOS Sequoia support)
	- Update [kext] `VoodooI2C` & its satellite `VoodooI2CHID` v. 2.9 beta: added confidence bit for palm rejection [Reference](https://github.com/VoodooI2C/VoodooI2C/pull/547)
	- Update [kext] `VoodooInput` v. 1.1.5: since **macOS Sequoia** dropped the IOKit personalities for the older SPI touchpads (including the one used by `VoodooInput`), now it is used `MacbookAir10,1` ID instead of SPI touchpad ID on macOS 12+


> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Change `Misc -> Security -> SecureBootModel` from `Default` to `Disabled` prior to updating to **macOS Sequoia**. You can re-enable it afterwards; otherwise the update (or new install) fails!
> - Since **macOS Sequoia** dropped support for `MacBookAir8,2` (MacBook Air 2018), I **switched back** to `MacBookPro15,2`.

	
> [!CAUTION]
> 
> After upgrading to **macOS Sequoia Beta 7**, the current state is the following:
> - its installation is less problematic than previous versions of macOS that required deeper changes to `OpenCore` and kexts;
> - the system feels snappier and more responsive than latest macOS Sonoma release;
> - disabled [kext] `AirportItlwm` and enabled [kext] `itlwm` (+ `Heliport` app): atm there is no support for [kext] `AirportItlwm` while latest `itlwm` is working fine;
> - Bluetooth support seems to be broken (i.e. device is not recognized): atm [kext] `IntelBluetoothFirmware` v. 2.5.0 beta seems working fine only on specific devices and/or on specific Beta releases...
> - sleep is not working... (the screen goes black but the PC stays on): I'm waiting for Release Candidate support (this issue could be related to beta stage)

	Update to **macOS Sonoma 14.5 (23F79)**
	
    **Update**
    - Update `OpenCore` v. 1.0.0


> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> During the update process, change in `config.plist` of your `EFI/OC` boot folder the entry `Misc -> Security -> SecureBootModel` from `Default` to `Disabled`; this fixes a known issue where macOS 14.4+ upgrade (or new install) will start to install, but will constantly reboot after the first (install-driven) reboot.

- **04-10-2023**

    **Very important announcement**: without the need to mess with hidden BIOS options nor to inject modified firmware into the appropriate chipset, I was able to both (seemingly) stably **load the native macOS drivers for the Thunderbolt controller** and get **the Thunderbolt hotplug working without the need to plug in a device at boot!**

    What has been achieved so far:
    - [x] Loading native macOS drivers for Thunderbolt Controller
    - [x] Booting with Thunderbolt device connected
    - [x] Thunderbolt Hotplug with Cold Boot
    - [x] Thunderbolt Hotplug with Warm Boot
    - [x] **Thunderbolt Hotplug with no Device Connected at Boot**
    - [x] Sequence of multiple Thunderbolt Hotplug/unplug during same working session
    - [x] Sleep with Thunderbolt Device Connected
    - [x] Wake with Thunderbolt Device Connected
    - [x] Shutdown with Thunderbolt Device Connected

    What still needs to be done:
    - [ ] Thunderbolt Auto Reconnect after Sleep (after wake, my external `OWC` disk is still attached/visible, but it is not user accessible...)
    - [ ] quantifying battery drain
    - [ ] updating Thunderbolt notes on `Readme` file

    Since everything else is working wonderfully, perhaps this could be the last substantial upgrade to the configuration!

- **03-12-2022**

    **Update**
    - Reduced number of interrupts: (little) improvement for battery

- **03-09-2022**

    **Update**
    - Update `OpenCore` v. 0.7.9
    - Update all kexts

    **OpenCore**
    - Update `config.plist` to support `OpenCore` v. 0.7.9
    - Added binary patches useful for debugging

- **02-26-2022**

    **Testing**
    - Discrete Graphics card NVIDIA GeForce MX150 totally disabled at PCI level (total new approach!):
        - `\_SB.PCI0.RP01` is not present anymore in IORegistryExplorer tree
        - this introduces no (new) issues during sleep/wake-up phase (i.e. sleep and wake-up work flawlessly as usual)
        - reduced time for putting our machine to sleep and for resuming it from sleep (i.e. machine is more reactive during these phases!)

- **02-20-2022**

    **Testing**
    - Improved config for Thunderbolt controller:
        - only partial hotplug achieved:
            - Thunderbolt structure is properly updated
            - new attached device (in my case `pci1cc1,5766@0`) is visible in Thunderbolt structure
            - but `IONVMeController` is not loaded for my external OWC Envoy Express
        - honestly I'm out of ideas... Everything is working very smoothly (native mode) if device is plugged in before pressing power button!

- **02-13-2022**

    **Testing**
    - Improved config for Thunderbolt controller:
        - drivers are properly loaded even with cold boot without any device attached to Thunderbolt controller

- **02-05-2022**

    **Update**
    - Update [kext] stripped `AirportItlwm_Big_Sur` v. 2.2.0 alpha (commit 29e863e)
    - Update [kext] stripped `AirportItlwm_Catalina` v. 2.2.0 alpha (commit 29e863e)
    - Update [kext] stripped `AirportItlwm_Monterey` v. 2.2.0 alpha (commit 29e863e)

    **Testing**
    - Improved config for Thunderbolt controller:
        - some DSB are checked to be unuseful i.e. minimal config found

- **01-26-2022**

    **Testing**
    - Improved config for Thunderbolt controller:
        - now if no TB nor USB3 device is attached then laptop is able to resume not only from sleep but also from hibernation state (no more kernel panic due to thunderbolt power on failed)

- **01-25-2022**

    **Testing**
    - With actual config, if USB3 device is attached during cold boot, then 
        - Thunderbolt XHC Controller is properly loaded (it is displayed in the `System Information -> PCI` section)
        - USB3 device is displayed as a child in the USB 3.1 Bus branch in the `System Information -> USB` section
        - USB3 device is properly attached on `DSB2 -> XHC2` branch in IORegistryExplorer
    - hot-plug is not working yet... maybe it is BIOS settings related...

- **01-24-2022**

    **Testing**
    - Improved `DSB1` branch on Thunderbolt interface + fixed `USBCompanion` personalities:
        - with device attached during cold boot, we get 100% probability for the following:
            - Thunderbolt drivers are loaded and displayed correctly in the `System Information -> Thunderbolt` section
            - Thunderbolt controller + Thunderbolt USB extensible controller + OWC interface are displayed in the `System Information -> PCI` section
            - OWC Envoy Express is properly mounted (OWC volume is displayed on Desktop) [expected performance is achieved with Read speed around 1370 MB/s and Write speed around 1300 MB/s measured with AmorphousDiskMark]
            - OWC Envoy Express supports sleep 
            - OWC Envoy Express is properly resumed from sleep
        - hot-plug is not working yet...

- **01-22-2022**

    **Update**
    - Update [kext] stripped `AirportItlwm_Big_Sur` v. 2.2.0 alpha (commit 43e1209)
    - Update [kext] stripped `AirportItlwm_Catalina` v. 2.2.0 alpha (commit 43e1209)
    - Update [kext] stripped `AirportItlwm_Monterey` v. 2.2.0 alpha (commit 43e1209)

    **Testing**
    - Some improvement in testing Thunderbolt interface; with the same config we face two different conditions:
        - First (device attached during cold boot):
            - Thunderbolt drivers are loaded and displayed correctly in the `System Information -> Thunderbolt` section
            - Thunderbolt controller + Thunderbolt USB extensible controller + OWC interface are displayed in the `System Information -> PCI` section
            - OWC Envoy Express is now properly mounted (OWC volume is displayed on Desktop)
            - OWC Envoy Express is resumed from sleep
        - Second (device attached during cold boot):
            - Thunderbolt controller + Thunderbolt USB extensible controller + OWC interface are displayed in the `System Information -> PCI` section
            - nothing else...
        
        It may be due to a timing race condition... or to a not properly configured thunderbolt tree...

- **01-16-2022**
    
    **Update**
    - Update [kext] stripped `AirportItlwm_Big_Sur` v. 2.2.0 alpha (commit 829bd91)
    - Update [kext] stripped `AirportItlwm_Catalina` v. 2.2.0 alpha (commit 829bd91)
    - Update [kext] stripped `AirportItlwm_Monterey` v. 2.2.0 alpha (commit 829bd91)

    **Testing**
    - Testing new Thunderbolt support since I was gifted by an OWC Envoy Express

- **01-03-2022**
    
    **Update**
    - Update [kext] stripped `AirportItlwm_Big_Sur` v. 2.1.0 stable (commit 2156b3d)
    - Update [kext] stripped `AirportItlwm_Catalina` v. 2.1.0 stable (commit 2156b3d)
    - Update [kext] stripped `AirportItlwm_Monterey` v. 2.1.0 stable (commit 2156b3d)

    **Testing**
    - Testing new CPU power management:
        - replacing actual (sofisticated) `SSDT-PM.aml` with its basic version
        - using latest [kext] `CPUFriend`
        - implementing "by-hand" [kext] `CPUFriendDataProvider`
        - (positive point) minimal lesser battery drain during idle
        - (negative point) maybe after wake-up process Intel GPU drain during idle is a little higher (?): more tests are needed...
    - Dropping original `DMAR.aml` (DMA Remapping Table) and replacing it with a purged version determines:
        - (positive point) lesser battery drain during idle
        - (negative point) during the so-called "sleep process" standby phase is reduced to zero seconds since it is immediately followed by hibernation phase (even if `standby == 1` and `hibernatemode == 3` flags are set)

    **Update to macOS Monterey 12.0.1 (21A559)**

    As reported in date 10-22-2021 you need to update kext `BlueToolFixup` to v. 2.6.1 beta ([commit 44c3025](https://github.com/profzei/Matebook-X-Pro-2018/issues/186#issuecomment-948783116)) for partially fixing **Bluetooth**.

    Atm, all non-Brcm chipsets are considered by macOS Monterey as `THIRD_PARTY_DONGLE`s: this explains why atm once Bluetooth is turned off, it cannot be turned on again until a restart or proper killing `bluetoothd`.
    
    We need to wait for a fix from **OpenCore Team** and/or **OpenIntelWireless** one-single-man-Team!

- **10-22-2021**

    **Update**
    - Update [kext] `BlueToolFixup` v. 2.6.1 beta ([commit 44c3025](https://github.com/profzei/Matebook-X-Pro-2018/issues/186#issuecomment-948783116)):
        - Apple added a USB vendor id check in Monterey Beta 10+ releases and considers non-Brcm and non-CSR dongles as unsupported devices
        - This new version disables the `bluetoothd`'s vendor id check introduced in Monterey Beta 10+
        - Known issues not fixed yet by **developers**:
            - once Bluetooth is turned off, it cannot be turned on again until a restart, similar to previous Monterey beta versions [Reference](https://github.com/profzei/Matebook-X-Pro-2018/issues/186#issuecomment-949618728)
            - still need to kill `bluetoothd` after S4 sleep for it to work

    Update (flawlessly) to **macOS Monterey** 12.0 Beta 6 (21A5506j) with Bios Secure Boot enabled.

    Since **macOS Monterey** 12.0 Beta 5 the only way to be able to use **Bluetooth** seems changing `SMBIOS` from (new) `MacBookPro16,3` to (old) `MacBookPro14,1` or `MacBookPro15,2` ([Reference issue#182](https://github.com/profzei/Matebook-X-Pro-2018/issues/182#issuecomment-909834358) credit to **@samwzlim**). From now on I choose to use `MacBookPro15,2` to give our build more longevity for future updates...
    
    Therefore, please, remember to **update your Device details** under `PlatformInfo -> Generic` section for proper **iServices** behaviour!


    **Update**
    - Update `SSDT-PM.aml`: reflecting changes introduced with **SMBIOS** `MacBookPro15,2`

- **08-30-2021**

    **Update**
    - Update `SSDT-BIOS.aml`: implemented a more general approach regardless of the BIOS version 

    **OpenCore**
    - Update `config.plist`: removed for `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)` the key `force-online` (which was set to `<data>AQAAAA==</data>`). Why?
        - With latest `WhateverGreen` releases our available connector types are 1 LVDS (internal monitor) and 2 DP; using an external monitor connected with a USB C-type to DP cable I verified the correct recognition and functioning of my BenQ PD2500Q even after the system wake-up. This `force-online` key could instead be useful for connections using a USB-C type to HDMI cable.
        - Eliminating this key reduces tons of warning messages like `[IGFB] [ERROR] [AGDC] Failed with status -536870212 for stream access aux` in system log during boot phase: that warning is correct/normal since it reports that the display is not connected for the remaining ports (i.e. `FB1` and `FB2` in our case using only `FB0` i.e. internal display); eliminating those warnings reduces log-file size (in debug-mode) from 2.6 to 1.6 MB thus reducing slightly boot loading time. [Reference](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/1318)

- **08-29-2021**

    **Update**
    - Update `SSDT-ARPT.aml`: removed `_STA` methods according to `SMBIOS MacBookPro16,1` (macOS-native approach)
    - Update `SSDT-DTB3.aml`:
        - fixed some weird ACPI errors during boot phase
        - implemented a better condition for Thunderbolt device's power management
        - more robust macOS system check
    - Update `SSDT-NVME.aml`: more robust macOS system check

    **OpenCore**
    - Update `config.plist`: added `pci-aspm-default` key (set to value `02000000` for `L1` mode) for forcing proper power management

- **08-24-2021**

    **Update**
    - Update `SSDT-PM.aml`: added `ACST` and `APSS` methods for `Processor Objects`

    **OpenCore**
    - Update `config.plist` with initial support for Intel DPTF framework for performance tuning:
        - now, in `PCI Devices` section, the driver for `Signal Processing Controller for Intel(R) Xeon E3-1200 v5/E3-1500 v5/6th Gen Core Processor Thermal Solution` is loaded
        - now `IETM` and `B0D4` devices are correctly attached as reported by `IORegistryExplorer`

    With the changes made, using `Intel Power Gadget`, it is noted that the value of consumption (`CPU Total Package` as reported by `HWMonitor`), in idle conditions, passes from about 1.40-1.50 W (as reported [here](https://github.com/profzei/Matebook-X-Pro-2018/issues/181)) to about 1.10-1.20 W:
    - these tests were performed on **macOS Monterey Beta 5**: for this version it is not possible to test `AirportItlwm.kext v. 1.3.0`
    - these tests were performed **without** enabling **undervolting** yet

- **08-23-2021**

    **Update**
    - Update [kext] stripped `AirportItlwm_Big_Sur` v. 2.1.0 beta (commit 7d722e4)
    - Update [kext] stripped `AirportItlwm_Catalina` v. 2.1.0 beta (commit 7d722e4)
    - Update [kext] stripped `AirportItlwm_Monterey` v. 2.1.0 beta (commit 7d722e4)
    - Update [kext] stripped `IntelBluetoothFirmware` v. 2.1.0 beta (commit b66baff)
    - Update [kext] stripped `IntelBluetoothInjector` v. 2.1.0 beta (commit b66baff)

- **08-16-2021**

    **Eureka!: BIOS Secure Boot enabled for OpenCore**
    - Implemented procedure to start `OpenCore` when **Secure Boot** option is **enabled** in `BIOS`: this procedure allows/preserves **dual booting** with **Windows 10** (and, in the future, with **Windows 11**)
    - Created two shell scripts (to try) to simplify/automate the necessary sequence of steps.
    - Tested on macOS Monterey 12.0 Beta 4 (21A5294g)

    Update (flawlessly) to **macOS Monterey** 12.0 Beta 5 (21A5304g) with Bios Secure Boot enabled.

- **08-07-2021**

    **Update**
    - Update `SSDT-RMNE.aml`: changed (fake) MAC Address with an OUI that corresponds to a real Apple, Inc. interface (for reference see [Apple OUI ID](https://ouilookup.com/vendor/apple)) to improve feedback on security checks
    - Update `SSDT-VDEV.aml`: 
        - changed `MEM2` device scope (macOS-native approach)
        - added `XSPI` device according to `SMBIOS MacBookPro16,1` (macOS-native approach)

    **OpenCore**
    - Update `config.plist`: updated `PlatformInfo -> Generic -> ROM` value according to Apple OUI set in `SSDT-RMNE.aml`

- **08-06-2021**

    **Update**
    - Update `OpenCore` v. 0.7.2

    **OpenCore**
    - Update `config.plist` to support `OpenCore` v. 0.7.2:
        - Added `UEFI -> AppleInput -> GraphicsInputMirroring` key and set its value to `true`
        - Added `NVRAM -> Add -> 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 -> ForceDisplayRotationInEFI` key and set its value to `0`
        - Added `NVRAM -> Delete -> 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 -> ForceDisplayRotationInEFI` key

    **Note**: `OpenCore` v. 0.7.1 - 0.7.2 brings fewer changes than we have seen in previous versions: major modifications are in regards to security improvements i.e. changes in Apple Secure Boot model and APFS driver.

    In `config.plist`:
    - `UEFI -> AppleInput -> GraphicsInputMirroring` boolean value: this is to prevent keyboard input from not working in graphics-based applications such as Windows BitLocker that use non-Apple key input methods even when an AppleEvent key handler (e.g. `CrScreenshotDxe.efi`) is active (reference on [OpenCore bug tracker](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/1716))
    - from `OpenCore` v. 0.7.2+ there is in `UEFI -> APFS` section an increased default APFS `MinDate` and `MinVersion` value to **macOS Big Sur** for better security:
        - setting `UEFI -> APFS -> MinDate` to `0` (default) value means that the minimum allowed APFS driver date to be loaded is 2021/01/01 atm
        - setting `UEFI -> APFS -> MinVersione` to `0` (default) value means that minimum allowed APFS driver version to be loaded is related to macOS Big Sur
    These are the suggested values if you are using macOS Big Sur or Monterey.

    Check Dortania's Configuration doc for older macOS versions. To make sure APFS driver loads on macOS Catalina and earlier, you could set (even if it is deprecated...) `UEFI -> APFS -> MinDate` to `-1` value & `UEFI -> APFS -> MinVersione` to `-1` value respectively: in this way this check is disabled.

- **08-05-2021**

    **macOS Monterey Beta**
    Initial support for macOS Monterey Beta (21A5248p):
    - Reference for a partial (almost all) working config could be found in [r/hackintosh](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/nx3ha5/just_imagine_the_macbook_with_minimal_bezels_and/) and in [r/MatebookXPro](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatebookXPro/comments/nx38ga/got_macos_monterey_up_and_running_on_the_matebook/); what was not working?
        - `AirportItlwm.kext` needed to be changed with `itlwm.kext` + `HeliPort` app
        - Bluetooth support was totally broken in macOS Monterey Beta 1
    - Now some more steps have been performed for a wider hardware support:
        - add `-lilubetaall` in `NVRAM -> boot-args` section in `config.plist`
        - `AirportItlwm.kext` is **now working** on macOS Monterey Beta 1:
            - Make sure AirportItlwm Monterey [**v. 2.0.0 beta**](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases) is used
        - **Bluetooth** is **now working** on macOS Monterey Beta 1:
            - Make sure `IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext` [**v. 1.1.3**](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware/releases) or newer is used
            - Exclude the injection of `IntelBluetoothInjector.kext`
            - Include `BlueToolFixup.kext` from [acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM](https://github.com/acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM)

    Update to macOS Big Sur 11.2 (20D64)

- **01-31-2021**

    **Update**
    - Update `SSDT-KBD.aml` for remapping hotkeys F7, F9, F10 to F16, F17 and F18 thus allowing custom shortcuts (enhancement suggested by **@R-Teer**: waiting for his guide about hotkey assignment)

    **OpenCore**

- **01-15-2021**

    **Update**
    - Update [kext] `AirportItlwm_Big_Sur` v. 1.2.0 stable: [OpenIntelWireless](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm) developer team (sadly) revert Tx Aggregation due to its instability (see commit [6d31398](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/commit/6d31398f35d12bb07a8ed0c95482d81b9cc29f11))

- **01-07-2021**

    **Update**
    - Add `SSDT-BIOS.aml` (testing) which defines a new `_QBF,0,N` method (i.e. referred to `EC0`) found in original HUAWEI BIOS v. 1.33:
        - it's the only difference from HUAWEI BIOS v. 1.28 (supported atm in this repo) or v. 1.30
        - according to [this post in Reddit r/MatebookXPro](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatebookXPro/comments/kksexv/matebook_x_pro_bios_version_133_released_12242020/gh5jpkm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) MBXP's overheat when plugged in (reported by some users in the same sub r/MatebookXPro) should be fixed or at least improved
    - Restructing actual configuration for repo:
        - Delete `BOOT` folder (outdated to OpenCore v. 0.6.3)
        - Delete `OC` folder (outdated to OpenCore v. 0.6.3)
        - Update `Readme` accordingly

    - Update [kext] stripped `AirportItlwm_Catalina` v. 1.2.0 beta (commit 3f244c8)
    - Update `SSDT-XHC.aml`: fixed loading for Intel(R) Bluetooth device
    - Add `SSDT-ARPT.aml` for OSX-native ACPI-interface for (Airport) WiFi-cards: it handles complete power-down of PCIe interface if OS requests it as on genuine machines

- **01-02-2021**

    **Update**
    - Update `SSDT-XHC.aml` adding `_STA,0,N` method

        - support for Battery Information Supplement implementing `BAT0.CBIS,0,N` and `BAT0.CBSS,0,N` methods
        - splitting for some EC fields (respectively `B0TM`, `B0C1`, `B0CV`)

    Sidenote for Bluetooth (loading) issue: according to [stevezhengshiqi's opinion](https://github.com/daliansky/XiaoMi-Pro-Hackintosh/issues/522#issuecomment-753402849) it could be a driver issue from IntelBluetoothFirmware. A simple way to fix it could be a boot script (not a login script) powering down and then powering up BT device (script already written: only need for testing it) 

    Sidenote for Thunderbolt support: full TB support might be tricky as MateBook X Pro (2018) only has one TB-port and seems to be missing the usual switch between ports. Didn't look into it too much but it may be actually impossible to get it fully working (at least a better power management is achieved).

    - Debugging work:
        - debug some `_Qxx` EC methods related to AC plugging in actions (`SSDT-DBG.aml`)
        - debug some EC fields deducing their role (`SSDT-DBG.aml`)

- **12-30-2020**
    
    **OpenCore**
    - Add [config] for Intel(R) UHD Graphics 620 the property `AAPL00,override-no-connect` (EDID obtained from Linux)
    - Add [config] `RP09._INI,0,N to XINI,0,N` binary patch for disabling ICM (Integrated Connection Manager) for Thunderbolt support

- **12-29-2020**

    **Update**
    - Add more native Thunderbolt support (not only the previous PCIe-to-PCIe bridge mode):
        - native macOS drivers without patched Thunderbolt firmware (wip...)
        - slightly improved power management for Thunderbolt controller (wip...)
    - Update `SSDT-INIT.aml` for initializing Thunderbolt controller
    - Rename `SSDT-EC-USBX.aml` to `SSDT-EC.aml` removing USB power injection
    - Add `SSDT-XHC.aml` for native ACPI-implementation of USB 2.0/3.0 (only useful USB ports are active) and relative USB power injection
    - Remove `SSDT-UIAC.aml` (because of native ACPI-implementation for USB)
    - Remove [kext] `USBInjectALL` (because of native ACPI-implementation for USB) 

    **OpenCore**
    - Add [config] `_UPC,0,N to XUPC,0,N` binary patch (for USB support)
    - Add [config] `_GPE.NTFY,1,S to XTFY,1,S` binary patch (for Thunderbolt support)

    The new Thunderbolt implementation is compatible with native macOS support for proper automatic sleep (`hibernatemode 3`) and hibernation (`hibernatemode 25`). This work is largely untested since I didn't have Thunderbolt devices! Anyway it should be better than previous support (at least for power management!)
    
    The native ACPI-implementation for USB has revealed another (?) bug of our DSDT i.e. Bluetooth device is properly recognized at boot-time but it needs a toggle off/on cycle to be "active" (i.e. turned on): further investigation needed but probably a login script for toggle off/on Bluetooth device needed to be implemented (wip...)

    - Update `SSDT-PTSWAK-SLEEP.aml` fixing type for `SS3` (from `FieldUnitObj` to `IntObj`)
    - Rename `SSDT-BATT-HUAWEI.aml` to `SSDT-BAT0-HUAWEI.aml` modifying `BAT0._STA` and `EC0._REG` methods (updating `LIDS` and `PWRS` status variables)
    - Add [kext] `RestrictEvents` (commit 5f5f4bf) to replace `EFICheckDisabler`
    - Add `SSDT-LID.aml` for updating `LIDS` variable with LID status
    - Add `SSDT-NVME.aml` for handling NVMe SSD (injected properties to mimic MacbookPro14,1)
    - Add `SSDT-TPL1.aml` for re-enabling GPI0 pinning for touchpad
    - Remove [kext] `EFICheckDisabler`
    - Remove `SSDT-TB3HP.aml` (`Enabled` key set to `false` value) for better automatic sleep support: wip... more tests needed

    **OpenCore**
    - Add [config] support for managing in `Kernel -> Add` section `RestrictEvents.kext`
    - Add [config] `AC0._PSR,0,N to AC0.XPSR,0,N` binary patch
    - Add [config] `EC0.ECAV,0,N to EC0.XCAV,0,N` binary patch
    - Add [config] `LID._LID,0,N to LID.XLID,0,N` binary patch
    - Add [config] `EC0._Q81,0,N to EC0.XQ81,0,N` binary patch
    - Add [config] `BAT0._STA,0,N to BAT0.XSTA,0,N` binary patch
    - Add [config] `EC0._REG,2,N to EC0.XREG,2,N` binary patch
    - Remove [config] all entries in `NVRAM -> Add -> 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 -> boot-args` except for `-igfxnorpsc=1` (for Intel UHD620) and `itlwm_cc=IT` (for `AirportItlwm` country code support)
    - Remove [config] `acpi-wake-type` entry from `Pci(0x14, 0x0)` USB Controller

    For supporting full auto sleep mode (i.e. macOS default `hibernatemode 3`) atm two key steps are needed:
    - removing hot-plug for Thunderbolt devices (managed by `SSDT-TB3HP.aml`)
    - setting in macOS menubar `Soundflower (2ch)` to `None` as default settings instead of `Multi-Output Device` (this means that you need to manually set `Multi-Output Device` when it is necessary)

    The latter step is needed since Soundflower maintains an open audio channel even when no audio is playing (for reference see [Soundflower prevents screen saver, display and comptuer sleep #179](https://github.com/feniix/soundflower/issues/179#issuecomment-581544566))

- **11-16-2020**

    **Update**

    A lot of work has been developed under the hood to try to mimic the behavior of a real MacbookPro: it seems to me that the system is stable (all checks atm have been performed on Catalina 10.15.7 Supplemental Update which is taken as reference). Most of the patches in the ACPI section have been rewritten from scratch:
    - Add `SSDT-AC0.aml`: updated version of `SSDT-ADP1.aml` for patching AC-Device so that AppleACPIACAdapter-driver loads
    - Add `SSDT-INIT.aml`: patch for initializing some global variables
    - Add `SSDT-DDGPU.aml`: updated version of `SSDT-DDGPU-Optimus2.aml` for removing discrete GPU
    - Add `SSDT-KBD.aml`: updated version of `SSDT-FnKey2.aml`
    - Add `SSDT-PM.aml`: unique patch for fixing power management
    - Add `SSDT-PTSWAK-SLEEP.aml`: totally reworked patch for handling not only sleep/wake-up process but also for proper updating AC-state and lid-status
    - Add `SSDT-SHARE.aml`: patch for handling common utils for other SSDTs
    - Add `SSDT-VDEV.aml`: unique patch for handling virtual devices for macOS compatibility (DMAC, MCHC, MEM2, BUS0)
    - Update `SSDT-BATT-HUAWEI.aml`
    - Update `SSDT-EC-USBX.aml`
    - Update `SSDT-PNLF.aml`
    - Update `SSDT-PWRB.aml`
    - Remove `SSDT-DMAC.aml`
    - Remove `SSDT-DTPG.aml`
    - Remove `SSDT-MCHC.aml`
    - Remove `SSDT-MEM2.aml`
    - Remove `SSDT-PLUG-PR.PR00.aml`
    - Remove `SSDT-PMCR.aml`
    - Remove `SSDT-PTSWAK-Optimus2.aml`
    - Remove `SSDT-RMCF.aml` (pair with `SSDT-PTSWAK-Optimus2.aml`)
    - Remove `SSDT-SBUS.aml`
    - Remove `SSDT-TPXX.aml`
    	
    Analyzing OEM SSDTs, I found 3 critical errors on the ACPI setup under `SSDT-7-KBL-ULT.aml` (sensor hub). I report here in the following for my memory: there are 3 big screwups on methods (`\_SB.SGOV`) that require two arguments, being passed as a method (`\_SB.GGOV`) with one argument and then a "hanging" argument which then causes compilation errors.
    
    Correcting instances like:
    - `\_SB.SGOV (0x02010016, OLDV)`
    - `\_SB.SGOV (0x02010014, DFUE)`
    - `\_SB.SGOV (0x02010014, OLDV)`

    should let the board to handle power correctly.
    Therefore original `SSDT-7-KBL-ULT.aml` has been dropped from loading process (its entry added in `config.plist` in `ACPI -> Delete` section) in favour of its modified version `SSDT-7KBL.aml`

    **OpenCore**

    - Update `SSDT-BATT-HUAWEI.aml` to support memory management for Thermal Framework
    - Add `SSDT-ADP1.aml` to properly load `AppleACPIACAdapter`
    - Update `SSDT-TPXX.aml`: re-enabled and improved support for touchscreen due to the numerous requests (default option)
    - Add `SSDT-TPXX-NO.aml` (to be renamed in `config.plist` as `SSDT-TPXX.aml`): version for disabling touchscreen
    - Add [kext] `ACPIBatteryManager` for fixing (just for now) the very annoying issue due to flooding messages in `Console.app` -> `kernel PMRD: clamshell closed 0, disabled 0, desktopMode 0, ac 0 sleepDisabled 0` (ThreadID 0x74): atm the switch from `SMCBatteryManager` to `ACPIBatteryManager` has been necessary to obtain maximum system stability and ensure the best possible user experience... I'm not happy about this decision because `ACPIBatteryManager` breaks external battery managers! This is a very old random issue (references can be found [tonymacx86](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/lid-sensor-flooding-log-with-clamshellstatechanged.272312/), [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatebookXPro/comments/bvirux/dat_june_hackintosh_update/?sort=new), [InsanelyMac](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/342497-help-needed-virtualsmc-causes-periodic-updates-of-clamshell-state/), [gnodipac886's repo](https://github.com/gnodipac886/MatebookXPro-hackintosh/issues/75)). **Any contribute is very welcomed!**

		- Add the `framebuffer-conX-has-lspcon` property both for connector 1 and connector 2 (to inform the driver which connector has an onboard LSPCON adapter)
		- Add the `framebuffer-conX-preferred-lspcon-mode` property both for connector 1 and connector 2 to specify `DP to HDMI 2.0` mode for LSPCON adapter

- **05-22-2020**
    - Update `Clover` v. 5118
    - Restored `SSDT-PLUG-PR.PR00.aml` to improve `cf-frequency-data` section for CPU `i7-8550U`

- **05-20-2020**
    - Update `Clover` v. 5117
	- The way to modify BIOS has been found and successfully applied: CFG-Lock removed and DVMT changed
		- `CFG Lock` now is set to `disabled` (previous value was `enabled`)
		- `DVMT Pre-Allocated` was already set to `64 MB` (which is the maximum value available)
		- `DVMT Total Gfx Mem` now is set to `MAX` (previous value was `256 MB`)
		- `Intel(R) SpeedStep` was already set to `enabled`
		- `Intel(R) Speed Shift` was already set to `enabled`
	- Set [config] `KernelPM` value to `false`: this parameter affected only post-Haswell CPUs with CFG locked
	- Remove [config] in section `KernelToPatch` binary patch `MSR 0xE2 -xcpm-idle instant reboot`
	- Remove [config] `framebuffer-fbmem` and `framebuffer-stolenmem` keys for UHD 620 Graphics card
	- Remove (till next update...) `SSDT-TPD0.aml` since it refers to touchscreen (`TPD0`)
	- Add `SSDT-GPI0.aml` and `SSDT-TPL1.aml` for touchpad GPIO interrupt mode: it uses VoodooInput bundled inside VoodooI2C (no need for external kext)
	- Add [config] 2 binary patches:
		- `_STA to XSTA for Device GPI0` to pair `SSDT-GPI0.aml`
		- `_CRS to XCRS for Device TPL1` to pair `SSDT-TPL1.aml` (touchpad)
	- Add [config] in section `KextToPatch` 2 binary patches respectively `com.apple.driver.AppleIntelLpssI2C` and `com.apple.driver.AppleIntelLpssI2CController` even if these two "old" issues should be fixed with `VoodooI2C` v. 2.4 (GenI2C app in "Diagnose" section still checks the presence of these two patches)
	- Add [config] `SSDT->NoOemTableId` key and its value is set to `false`
	- Remove [config] old and unused key `DropTables->#MCFG`
	- Remove [config] `DSDT->ReuseFFFF` key (its value was set to `false`)
	- Remove [config] `DSDT->Debug` key (its value was set to `false`)
	- Remove [config] `DSDT->DropOEM_DSM` key since `Clover` v. 5117 dropped it
    - Remove [config] `Boot->Debug` key (its value was set to `false`)
    - Add [config] `Graphics->EDID->Inject` key to value `yes` since it is checked that the right value is injected
    - Remove [config] `KernelAndKextPatches->Debug` key (its value was `false`)
    - Remove [config] `KernelAndKextPatches->DellSMSBIOSPatch` key (its value was `false`)
    - Remove [config] `KernelCPU` key (its value was set to `false`)
    - Remove [config] `KernelLapic` key (its value was set to `false`)
    - Replaced `SSDT-XCPM.aml` with standard (OpenCore project) `SSDT-PLUG-PR.PR00.aml`
    - Implemented in `SSDT-PLUG-PR.PR00.aml` method `_PPC` for "Performance Present Capabilities" [credit to Zero-zer0]
    - Update [config] `Devices->Properties` to let `System Information.app` show more Properties in PCI0 devices
        - for PCI Bridges `reg-ltrovr` property is injected: `IOPCIFamily.kext` will set latency tolerance offset for each of the latency tolerance devices (this could fix some potential issues)

- **05-11-2020**
	- Add [config] attribute `acpi-wake-type` to the USB Controller in Device `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x14,0x0)` to fix sleep when lid is closed (during sleep state both CapsLock and Fn leds are off; display wakes up properly)
	- Set [config] `AppleIntelCPUPM` value to `false` since this parameter affects only pre-Haswell CPUs
	- Set [config] `KernelPM` value to `true`: this parameter is needed for proper CPU Power Management if CFG-Lock can't be disabled in BIOS for Haswell and newer CPUs
	- Set [config] `HWPEnable` value to `true`: with an `SMBIOS` like MacBookPro14,x which supports HWP technology (i.e. Intel SpeedShift), CPU handles pstate management by itself (CPU itself automatically shift to higher and lower pstates depending on CPU demand instead of requiring the OS to do it)

- **05-10-2020**
    - Add `SSDT-TPD0.aml` to enable APIC interrupt mode: it uses VoodooInput bundled inside VoodooI2C (no need for external kext)
    - Remove `SSDT-SLPB.aml` (it added support for "sleep button")
    - Remove `SSDT-DeepIdle.aml`: it added support for "deep idle" at software level, but, in some (unknown) way, it breaks it at hardware level with a battery discharge rate of about 2% per hour during sleep state
    - Modified [config] framebuffer for UHD 620 Graphics card to `C0870005`:
        - no more glitches during boot transition from 1st to 2nd stage
        - full support for software sleep state: during sleep state both CapsLock and Fn leds are off; display wakes up properly (no more split screen issue!)
        - custom patching for each connector (con 0: LVDS, con 1: HDMI, con 2: HDMI): support up to two 4K @ 60 Hz monitors
        - enabled digital audio with `hda-gfx` property
        - enabled (standard) semantic patches for BIOS with DVMT Pre-Alloc 32 MB when higher is required (`fbmem`= 9 MB, `stolenmem`= 38 MB)
        - enabled HDMI in UHD resolution with 60 fps with `-cdfon` boot-arg and `enable-hdmi20` property: this could fix random `gIOScreenLockState3` error during boot phase
        - added the `disable-external-gpu` property
        - added `-igfxmlr` boot-arg and `enable-dpcd-max-link-rate-fix` property: this could fix random kernel panic due to a "division-by-zero"
        - specified a maximum link rate value via the `dpcd-max-link-rate` property for builtin display: `0x06` for RBR, `0x0A` for HBR (typically used for 1080p display), `0x14` for HBR2 (typically used for 4K display) and `0x1E` for HBR3
    - Improved details in Graphics section
    - Add [config] new LiteON CA3 patch `IONVMeFamily Preferred Block Size 0x10 -> 0x02` in `KextsToPatch` section [credit to ygy3389]
